# Refraction-of-Light
For Pravega Exhibition 2024 - Arjun Sai Hulikal, Abhyudaya HP

THIS PROGRAM WAS MADE BY ARJUN SAI HULIKAL

Instructions to use the program-

1. To use this program, first run it with a valid python interpreter.
2. You will be asked to input a color (In proper casing). If unnecessary, input "White"
3. Next, input the media (In proper casing).
4. Finally, input the angle of incidence (NOTE - the program breaks with an angle greater than 90', as the incident ray reaches the surface from below.

Important notes - Differences in speed are very miniscule to observe, but are there. Differences in the bending of colours are also miniscule. The critical angle for glass is shown as 41'. Please note that there are many types of glass, so variations in the refractive index occur.

Thank you,
